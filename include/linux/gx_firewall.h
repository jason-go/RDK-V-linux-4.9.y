/*
 * firewall_config_filter()
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *      Set master read and write permissions to filter(can also understand the filter as buf)
 *
 *  PARAMETER
 *      @addr
 *           The start addr in RAM of this filter, addr must aligned by 1KB
 *      @size
 *           The size in RAM of this filter, size must aligned by 1KB
 *      @master_rd_permission
 *           Configure which masters have read permissions to this filter, example MASTER_A7_TEE|MASTER_MAC_USB_NFC
 *      @master_wr_permission
 *           Configure which masters have write permissions to this filter, example MASTER_A7_TEE|MASTER_MAC_USB_NFC
 *
 *  RETURN VALUE
 *      On sucess, zero is returned
 *      On error, a negative value is returned
 *
 *  NOTES
 *
 *  EXAMPLE
 *      firewall_config_filter(0x10000000, 0x200000, MASTER_A7_TEE | MASTER_MAC_USB_NFC, MASTER_GSE | MASTER_A7_TEE | MASTER_VPU);
 *      set protect space (0x10000000 ~ 0x10200000)ï¼Œset master A7_TEE/MAC/USB/NFC has read permission, master GSE/A7_TEE/VPU has write permission
